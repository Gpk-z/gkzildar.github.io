Bengaluru being one such city has more than 12,000 restaurants with restaurants serving dishes from all over the world. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasnâ€™t been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day.
In spite of increasing demand, it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. Most of them serving the same food. Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.
