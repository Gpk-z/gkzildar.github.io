## Instacart Basket Analysis - Python Project 


### Goal
Deliver a final report including tables and visualizations that profile Instacart customers based on their purchase behaviors.

## INSTACART
Python-based project on Consumer Behavior Trends and Marketing Analysis through CareerFoundry Data Analytics Program.

## OBJECTIVE 
Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. While they already have a very good sales, the management team wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. They are mostly interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and theyâ€™re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They want to target different customers with applicable marketing campaigns to see whether they have an effect on the sale of their products. 

## DATA
