## GameCo Analysis

### OBJECTIVE

Perform a 10 year descriptive analysis to gain insights into the current video game
developments for marketing and sales teams’ 2017 budget planning

### Key Questions and Objectives:
* Are certain types of games more popular than others?
* What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
* Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
* How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?

### Goal 
As a Data Analyst at Rockbuster Stealth* LLC, I am supposed to address these business questions using SQL and visualizations in Tableau. 

### Data Source
Throughout this course, you’ll be using a data set that covers historical sales of
video games (for games that sold more than 100,000 copies) spanning different
platforms, genres, and publishing studios. This data was drawn from the website
VGChartz . [link](https://www.vgchartz.com/).
