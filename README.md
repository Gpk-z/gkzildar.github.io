## Instacart Basket Analysis - Python Project 

### Objective
I am an analyst for an existing company, Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. Instacart already has very good sales, but they
want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I've performed an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order
to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria.

### Purpose and Context:
At CareerFoundry, I had a project that introduced me to the world of Python. This project allowed me to apply my analitical skills for performing exploratory analysis for a real-world big dataset.

### Goal
Deliver a final report including tables and visualizations that profile Instacart customers based on their purchase behaviors.
